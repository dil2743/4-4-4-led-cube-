# 4-4-4-led-cube-
The cube has 64 Red LEDs which make up its 4 layers(positives) and 16 columns(negatives). These are all wired to an Arduino nano. An Arduino is a single-board microcontroller, intended to make the application of interactive objects or environments more accessible. The hardware consists of an open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. I programmed code(sketches) for the Arduino Uno to control the individual LEDs to display patterns for this captivating desktop light show.
 
 The code is self explaiotry, for making connection fallow the comments in 444ledCube.ino file.
