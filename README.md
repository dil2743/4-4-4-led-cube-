# 4-4-4-led-cube-
 The cube has 64 Red LEDs which make up it's 4 layers(positives) and 16 columns(negatives). These are all wired to a Arduino nano. An Arduino is a single-board microcontroller, intended to make the application of interactive objects or environments more accessible. The hardware consists of an open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. I programed code(sketches) for the Arduino Uno to controll the individual LEDs to display patterns for this captivating desktop light show.
